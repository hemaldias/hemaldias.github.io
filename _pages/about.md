I am a passionate design engineer with a strong interest and ability to develop innovative solutions in response to challenging open-ended problems. 

I graduated with a first-class in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Warwick before joining the double-master Innovation Design Engineering course at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London. I enjoy collaborating within interdisciplinary groups and combine my strong technical background and human centred design skills to deliver solutions that are not only innovative, but also feasible and effective.

My specific interests include technology, entrepreneurship and supporting under-represented communities.
