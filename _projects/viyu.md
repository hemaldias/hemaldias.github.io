viyu aims to **make air pollution awareness viral** by letting people collect and engagingly share their own hyper localised data.

It consists of an open-source, affordable and portable air pollution sensor that constantly monitors the concentration of air pollutants and syncs this data with an app. Its low-cost nature allows as many people as possible to own it, resulting in detailed localised evidence about air pollution. The project was developed for Delhi but has the potential for a global impact.

This is a group project as part of the Innovation Design Engineering course.

## The Problem

> Air pollution in India causes caused 1.24 million deaths in 2017. 

Glamourising motorised vehicle ownership, burning crops and excessive firework displays all contribute to the harmful substances in Delhi’s air. Having spoken to individuals and charities in the area, we learnt that many people don’t understand the environmental and health impact of these behaviours.

Only 15 out of 36 states in India have a monitoring system for key air pollutants in any given year, leading to extremely inconsistent air pollution data.

Our intervention had to meet these objectives:

1. Provide hyper localised air-pollution data.

2. This data must be easily understandable.

3. A campaign must be made to raise awareness of the issue.

## The Solution

Our device utilizes existing technology in a durable, portable and WiFi-enabled PM2.5 sensor that costs under £20, allowing people to have it with them as they carry out their day.

It automatically takes readings and sends those readings to their phone as well as beeps and flashes to warn the user when it detects significant changes.

The app uses visual representations of pollution level with engaging 3D graphics, making the data easier to understand and compelling to share on social media. App features include (left-to-right) realtime air pollution data, tracking pollution exposure throughout the day, monitoring air pollution data from other sensors in the network.

VIYU will promote sharing these compelling visuals to generate an awareness campaign.

## Technology Demonstration

As part of the project, I made a functional physical sensor prototype, along with an app. The video demonstrates what happens when the PM2.5 concentration in the room goes up.
