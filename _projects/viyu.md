viyu aims to make air pollution awareness viral by letting people collect and engagingly
share their own hyper localised data.

It consists of an open-source, affordable and portable air pollution sensor which constantly monitors the concentration of air pollutants and syncs this data with an app. Its low cost nature allows as many people as possible to own it, resulting in detailed localised evidence about air pollution. To make it even more accessible, we developed a DIY kit . The project was developed for Delhi but has the potential for a global impact.

## The Problem

Air pollution causes 4 million premature deaths annually. Unfortunately all evidence suggests that the problem is only set to get worse, especially in areas where it is already significant.  

India is among the worst countries affected, of which Delhi is one of the most impacted cities, due to both its local practices and geography.

Glamourising motorised vehicle ownership, burning crops and excessive firework displays all contribute to the harmful substances in Delhi’s air. Having spoken to individuals and charities in the area, we learnt that many people don’t understand the environmental and health impact of these behaviours.

At the heart of air pollution in India lies misinformation, lack of information, and misunderstanding of both the data and the health risk. Only 15 out of 36 states in India have a monitoring system for key air pollutants in any given year, leading to extremely
inconsistent air pollution data.

## The Solution

![](/images/viyu/objectives.jpg)

In order to be effective, our intervention had to meet three core objectives:

1. Everyone should have hyper local information about the air pollution that they are exposed to within their community.

2. This data must be understandable and represent the harms that air pollution can have on not just the environment, but on your health as well. 

3. Air pollution can no longer remain silent or invisible, but rather a campaign must be made to raise awareness of the issue from the perspective of the next generation.
