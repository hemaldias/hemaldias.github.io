## Project overview

We know that the electricity we consume at home comes from a mix of energy sources, with an increasing proportion being renewable. However, these green sources are heavily dependent on weather conditions, resulting in **intermittent and unpredictable supply**.  We designed homecell to **store electricity from the national grid when it is most renewable**, allowing clean energy to be used at home, any time, by anyone.

## How it works

The mix of energy sources (oil, nuclear, wind etc.) which feeds the UK national grid continuously varies throughout the day. **homecell** communicates with the National Grid API to determine when the energy coming from our plug sockets is the cleanest and sets its internal batteries to charge. Now when someone switches on an appliance connected to the homecell unit, it will use the energy stored in the batteries from when the energy was cleanest.
