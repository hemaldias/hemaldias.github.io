Coral Rescue is an IoT system allowing beginners to grow corals at home for conservation purposes. Having written a successful 12-million-yen grant fund, my prototypes are being rigorously tested in Tokyo and Virginia high schools. Students have successfully nurtured stubborn coral species and have a much clearer understanding and connection to the effect of climate change on corals.

## How it works

Having grown corals for a year, I made a system which measures the 3 most critical parameters - temperature, pH and water level (consequently salinity). These are sent to a web app which explains each parameter significance and how to adjust it.
