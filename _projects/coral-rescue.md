Coral Rescue is an IoT system allowing beginners to grow corals at home for conservation purposes. After personally writing a successful 12-million-yen grant fund, my prototypes are being rigorously tested in Tokyo and Virginia high schools. Students have successfully nurtured stubborn coral species and have a much clearer understanding and connection to the effect of climate change on corals.

Having grown corals for a year, I made a system which measures the 3 most critical parameters - temperature, pH and water level (consequently salinity). These are mesured with the sensors pictured above and sent to a web app which explains each parameter significance and how to adjust it.

The system auto-tops up evaporated water, eliminating the quickest coral killer while a timelapse camera provides an engaging visual aspect.

I experimented with various sensor configurations, made a PCB and fit it all into one casing which a beginner can simply hang onto the tank wall. Early prototypes were made from PLA with an FDM printer, but I later transitioned to SLS Nylon for longevitiy.
