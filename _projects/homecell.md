## Project Overview

We know that the electricity we consume at home comes from a mix of sources, with an increasing proportion being renewable. However, these green sources are heavily dependent on weather conditions, resulting in **intermittent and unpredictable supply**.  We designed homecell to **store electricity from the national grid when it is most renewable**, allowing clean energy to be used at home, any time, by anyone.

## Our Technology

**homecell** works by communicating with the National Grid to determine when the energy coming from our plug sockets is the cleanest. Using the additional data inputs of user data and energy suppliers, the software optimises charging and usage times. The software controls the hardware and connects to the homecell app and homecell API.

## Impact and Next Steps

With **homecell**, we can save around 125M tonnes of CO2 that would normally be generated by burning fossil fuels - equivalent to planting 5B trees. Additionally, the yearly electricity bill would be cut by 50% which is an average of £350.

In the long term, we want to move from residential electricity to small-scale commercial and ultimately into corporate spaces.

We aim to use homes to create a shift in behaviour and apply these in public spaces for a greener future in cities.
