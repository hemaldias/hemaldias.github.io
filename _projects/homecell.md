We know that the electricity we consume comes from a mix of sources, with an increasing proportion being renewable. However, these green sources are heavily dependent on weather conditions, resulting in **intermittent and unpredictable supply**. 

We designed homecell to **store electricity from the national grid when it is most renewable**, allowing clean energy to be used at home, any time, by anyone. Giving the power back to the people in the green energy transition.

This is a group project as part of the Innovation Design Engineering Masters course.

## The Problem with Energy

Global energy production is still heavily dependent on burning non-renewable resources such as oil and gas, which significantly contribute to carbon emissions.

> “73% of global carbon emissions come from the energy sector” - World Resource Institute (2020)

The UK has pledged to improve the situation by becoming carbon net-zero before the year 2050. But there is a problem. When it is sunny and windy, we generate more green electricity than required which is currently just wasted. Conversely, when the weather is poor, we generate less green energy than required resulting in a dependence on fossil fuel-based generation.

## Our Solution

**What if we could store this renewable energy when it is available then use it at times when there is less available?**

This is **homecell**, an automatic plug-and-store green energy unit, so users can set it and leave it, making the green transition more easy & accessible. **homecell** would be accompanied by an app which allows you to control and monitor your units, and track your environmental impact.

## Our Technology

**homecell** works by communicating with the National Grid to determine when the energy coming from our plug sockets is the cleanest. Using the additional data inputs of user data and energy suppliers, the software optimises charging and usage times. The software controls the hardware and connects to the homecell app and homecell API.

Below is our technical demonstration with our functional prototype.

## Impact and Next Steps

With **homecell**, we can save around 125M tonnes of CO2 that would normally be generated by burning fossil fuels - equivalent to planting 5B trees. Additionally, the yearly electricity bill would be cut by 50% which is an average of £350.

In the long term, we want to move from residential electricity to small-scale commercial and ultimately into corporate spaces.

We aim to use homes to create a shift in behaviour and apply these in public spaces for a greener future in cities.
