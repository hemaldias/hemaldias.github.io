stablspoon is an award-winning stabilising spoon for people with hand tremors. The project is currently sponsored by both the Design Council and Alzheimer’s Society, with an anticipated release date of early 2023. Unlike competitor products which use complex electronic systems, stablspoon is fully mechanical allowing it to cost under £50 rather than over £200.

Our end users also complained about the embarrassment associated with using conventional bulky and white eating aids ,leading us to develop an aesthetically pleasing product that **people want, not just need**.

## The Problem (And Our Inspiration)

The project was inspired by a family friend called Ben who has a hand tremor rendering most day-to-day tasks difficult, with eating being exceptionally challenging. I wanted to help him but was shocked to see that existing assistive aids cost over £200. I knew a more accesible solution was possoble so embarked on my mission to remove the frustration from eating with a hand tremor.

Ben is not alone with up to 1 in 25 people worldwide having a tremor and eating being an anecdotal problem.
