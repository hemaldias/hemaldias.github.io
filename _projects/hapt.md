## Project overview

 Traditional video games for blind people rely completely on sound which is ineffective at communicating spatial information. For instance, a game like Tetris is impossible through only audio. HAPT inconspicuously sits on the wrist and connects to smartphones wirelessly. Inside, there are 4 specialised motors which gently tap the skin. When a gaming app is played, HAPT will tap in different arrangements depending on where the screen is touched. This allows blind people to intuitively understand the shape of game elements which adds a new dimension to their experience.
