What if the computers surrounding us know how we really feel?

relax! explores this concept by utilising a hacked EEG sensor headset to wirelessly monitor and transmit data regarding your stress and attention levels, rendering your mind as an IoT device.

The base station knows when you’re stressed, causing the relax flag to rise and an Oreo to be ‘printed’, encouraging you to take a break and enjoy a well-earned snack.

## The Problem

> Air pollution in India causes caused 1.24 million deaths in 2017. 

Glamourising motorised vehicle ownership, burning crops and excessive firework displays all contribute to the harmful substances in Delhi’s air. Having spoken to individuals and charities in the area, we learnt that many people don’t understand the environmental and health impact of these behaviours.

At the heart of air pollution in India lies misinformation, lack of information, and misunderstanding of both the data and the health risk.

Only 15 out of 36 states in India have a monitoring system for key air pollutants in any given year, leading to extremely inconsistent air pollution data.

In order to be effective, our intervention had to meet three core objectives:

1. Everyone should have hyper local information about the air pollution that they are exposed to within their community.

2. This data must be understandable and represent the harms that air pollution can have on not just the environment, but on your health as well.

3. Air pollution can no longer remain silent or invisible, but rather a campaign must be made to raise awareness of the issue from the perspective of the next generation.

## The Solution

Our device utilizes existing technology in a durable, portable and WiFi enabled PM2.5 sensor that costs under £20, allowing people to have it with them as they carry out their day.

It automatically takes readings without the user having to do anything and sends those readings to their phone as well as beeps and flashes to warn the user when it detects significant changes in the air around them.

The app uses visual representations of pollution level with engaging 3D graphics, making the data easier to understand and compelling to share on social media. App features include (left-to-right) realtime air pollution data, tracking pollution exposure throughout the day, monitoring air pollution data from other sensors in the network.

VIYU will promote sharing these compelling visuals to generate an awareness campaign.

## Technology Demonstration

As part of the project, I made a functional physical sensor prototype, along with an app. The video demonstrates what happens when the PM2.5 concentration in the room goes up.
